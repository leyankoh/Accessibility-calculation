(Work in Progress) Cleaning up some of the code used for calculating Singapore PTALs


This is some example code that was used to complete my undergraduate dissertation.
By no means may the final result, as shown below, be attained with just this code; a lot of it was also
used in conjunction with QGIS/ArcGIS to provide the final results (such as buffering/querying bus stop or train stop area subsets)
